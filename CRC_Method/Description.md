Cyclic Redundancy Check is a method for being ensure that the sent data is not corrupted during transfer over communication channels. A polynomial key is added to end of the data in transfer. This polynomial key is recognized by both sender and receiver device.

In this case the polynomial is set x^4+x+1, which corresponds to 0b00010011 in a byte.

Assembly language is used in this process. The algorithm is approved by a simulation in Proteus program.

The program concludes basically, taking input bits from a DIP switch (8-bit input) and demonstrate the result in LCD.

Only the LCD driver code is supplied from elsewhere.
